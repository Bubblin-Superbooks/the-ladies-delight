For this he forms the vicious Masquerade,
Where Damsels may securely drive their Trade,
For which the Salesman, Chandler, Chairmen loudly pray,
And Pickpockets too, _hail_ the joyful Day—

Who to _Ridotto_ gave an _English_ Birth;
To him let every Templar bend the Knee,
Receive a Ticket, and give up the Fee:

Let _Drury-Lane_ eternal Columns raise,
And every wanton Wife resound his Praise;
Let Courtiers with implicit Faith obey,
And to their grand Procurer Homage</pre></div> </div>
