Nor can her Mask her rising Blushes hide;

At last (as Bargains here are quickly made)

She yeilds to be Caress'd, tho' still afraid;

She cries, a private Room's for them most fit,

For Reputation is the Glory of a Cit;

This only is the Place, where in a Trice,

Some Angel steals the Wounds of friendly Vice;

The Nymph finds a Relief for all her</pre></div> </div>
