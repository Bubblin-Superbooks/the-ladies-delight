Stood hearkning by, and cry'd it was the P——ce.
Your Pardon, Sir, I knew it not before,
For my Mistake depended on his Whore,
One had _Latona_ to'ther has _L——r_.

How many Whores have at your Roots been made;

This one, this happy Night, alone will shew
So many, that each conscious _Dryad_ flees,
Lest she too should be ravish'd thro' the Trees.

Next rattling Dice invite th' attentive</pre></div> </div>
