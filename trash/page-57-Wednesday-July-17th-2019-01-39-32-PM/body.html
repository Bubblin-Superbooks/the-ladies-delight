<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Night,
And Sleep and Lust the Croud to Bed invite;

Some in their Truckle-Beds to snore all Day,
Others in Gambols with their Wh——es to play;
The Dunghill Trapes, trickt up like virtuous Trull,
If by good Chance, she gets a _Dupe_ or Cull;

On Tallyman intrudes twelve Hours more,
And for a clean Shift presumes to run a Score.
Sages may say, that Arts and Science fail,
And Ignorance and Folly have weigh'd down the Scale:

In _England_ they have given new Arts a Rise,
And what in Science wants, increase in Vice,
And to be great as Angels when they fell,
(If not exceed) at _least_ they equal _Hell_.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
