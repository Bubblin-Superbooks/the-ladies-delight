An Emblem terrible, but just retains.)
_Near_ where fam'd _Vaux_ was to have fled,
_With_ lighted Match, soon as he'd done the Deed;
Whence some pretend to say by second Sight,

That it foreshew'd the Fate attends this Night,
'Cause here the Fair will many _Matches light_.
_Spring-Gardens_ lie shaded with verdant Trees,
That nod their reverend Heads at every Breeze;

Embassadors like _Turks_ hence send Express,
And _Ministers of State_ like Devils dressâ€”
Should some wild _Indian_ see the various Scene,
He'd swear all Nations of the Earth do here convene,

And take for quite reverse this medley</pre></div> </div>
