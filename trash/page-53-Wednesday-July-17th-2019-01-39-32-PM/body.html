And when their Cash runs low, and Fate runs cross,
They then _Cornute_ 'em to retrieve their Loss.
_Dice_ and Intrigue so mutually are blended,

That one begins as soon as t'other's ended:
A City Heiress blooming, rich, and fair,
Picks up the Cards and Counters with great Care;
Against her fate a smooth young Baron,

Wit he had none, Beauty he had his share on,
A soft clear Skin, a dapper Neck and Waist,
In all Things suited to the modern Taste;
And most polite, like all our modish Brood,

That is, a very Fool, who's very leud:
He ogles Miss, she squints, and turns aside,
Nor can her Mask her rising Blushes</pre></div> </div>
