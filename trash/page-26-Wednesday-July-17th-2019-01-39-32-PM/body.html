And safely fetch the Swelling down.

Not Saffron chears the Heart like this,
Nor can Champaign give such a Bliss:
When Wife and Husband do fall out,
And both remain in sullen pout,

This brings them to themselves again,
And fast unites the broken Chain;
Makes Feuds and Discords straightway cease
And gives at least a _Night of Peace_.

This Rarity may now be seen
In _Lambeth_, at a Garden Green,
_Bowen_ his Name, who in high Tone,
Calls it the _Tree of Silver</pre></div> </div>
