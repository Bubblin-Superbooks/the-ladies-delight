Beaufets for Food, Grotto's for something else.
But hark! the Doors on jarring Hinges turn,
All enter in, and the blest Scene's begun;
A thousand Lights their livid Flames display,

Pour forth their Blaze, and form a mimick Day:
Sudden a motley Mixture fills the Place,
And Footmen shine as lordly as his Grace;
To see the sad Effect and Power of Change,

Ladies turn'd Men, in Breeches freely range:
Young smooth-chin'd Beaux turn Priests and Fryars,
And Nun's chaste Habits hide our Country 'Squires.
_Belles, Beaux_, and Sharpers here together play,

And Wives throw their good Spouses Wealth</pre></div> </div>
