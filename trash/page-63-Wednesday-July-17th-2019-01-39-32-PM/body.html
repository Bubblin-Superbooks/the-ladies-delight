He'd swear all Nations of the Earth do here convene,

And take for quite reverse this medley Farce,

Think Strumpers Saints, or catstick'd Beau a _Mars_.

But now the Dancers nimble Feet go round,

And with just Measures beat the passive Ground,

Each one inclines to different Delightsâ€”

Musick the Fair, Sweetmeats the Beau invite;

The _Templar_ wisely does his Care</pre></div> </div>
