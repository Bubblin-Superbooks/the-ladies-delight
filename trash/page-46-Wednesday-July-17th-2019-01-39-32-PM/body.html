And the spruce 'Prentice shines in Sword and Tye:

Bandy'd in Lace the City Dame appears,
Her Hair genteelly frizzled round her Ears;
Her Gown with _Tyrian_ Dyes most richly stain'd,
Glitt'ring with Orient Pearl from Orphans gain'd.

_My Lord_, to oblige his Spouse, takes Tickets three,
Crys, one's for you my Love, and one for me,
The third dispose as you shall best adjudge,
Shew where you're pleas'd, and where you owe a Grudge:

_Madam_ elate, thinks she'll be kind to _Betty_,
To hide the Slips she made with Spark i'th' City:
But _Stallion Tom_, who well knew how to scold,
And by his Mistress's Favour grown too</pre></div> </div>
