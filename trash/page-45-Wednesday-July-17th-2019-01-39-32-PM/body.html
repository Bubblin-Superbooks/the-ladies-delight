Vollies of Oaths speak loud the Drawer's Moan;
_Porter_ who us'd to search for needful Girls,
Now sucks his Fingers, or his Apron twirls,

Bemoans his Loss of Business, and with Sighs,
In Box imprison'd lays the useless Dice.
_Spring-Garden_ now alone does all invite
The Cit, the Wit, the Rake, the Fool, the Knight:

No Lady, that can pawn her Coat or Gown,
Will rest 'till she has laid the Money down:
Each Clerk will to the Joints his Fingers work,
And Counsellors find out some modern Querk,

To raise the Guinea, and to see the _Grot_,
And 'mongst the _Belles_ to slant it at _Ridolt_.
Here Seamstresses and Maids together</pre></div> </div>
