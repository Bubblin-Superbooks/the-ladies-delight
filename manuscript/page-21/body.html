<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>As the <em>Irish</em> soil is accounted the best, others are as remarkably bad for its cultivation; and the least and worst in the world are said to be about <em>Harborough</em> and the <em>Forest of Sherard</em>.</p><p>The stem seems to be of the <em>sensitive</em> tribe, tho' herein differing from the more common <em>Sensitives</em>; that whereas they are known to shrink and retire from even the gentlest touch of a Lady's hand, this rises on the contrary, and extends itself when it is so handled.</p><p>In winter it is not easy to raise these trees without a hot bed; but in warmer weather they stand well in the open air.</p><p>In the latter season they are subject to become weak and flaccid, and want support; for which purpose some gardeners have thought of splintering them up with <em>birchen Twigs</em>, which has seem'd of some service for the present, tho' the plants have very soon come to the same or a more drooping state than before.</p></div> </div>
