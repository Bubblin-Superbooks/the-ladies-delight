(As each Man should assist his Brother)

That is, to take especial Care
Not to set _Vulvaria_ near;
Of them two Sorts are frequent found,
One helps, and to'ther spoils the Ground;

And many a Plant thriving and tall,
Destroy'd by them, has got a Fall.
But _Misan_'s taken this just napping,
And _against all Things that can happen_

Both to the Shrub and Tree, has told some
How to make the deadliest _Wholesome_;
These venomous _Vulvaria_ grow
At _Vaux-Hall_ and _St. James's_</pre></div> </div>
