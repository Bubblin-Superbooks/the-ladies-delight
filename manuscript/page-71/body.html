And the lost Maidenhead's restor'd again.

But who is he in Bower close confin'd,

With a kind Fair t' unbend his troubled Mind,

Sure by his Air, his Beauty, and his Grace,

A petty Courtier, of small Estate and Sense,

Stood hearkning by, and cry'd it was the P——ce.

Your Pardon, Sir, I knew it not</pre></div> </div>
