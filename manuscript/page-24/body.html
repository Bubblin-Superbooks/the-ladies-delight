And proves from some old _Grecian_ Poet,
So plain that all Men sure must know it,
That of this _Tree_ the Club was made,
With which he overcame ('tis said)

_Thespius_' Daughters, all grown wild,
And _fifty Mad-Women_ made _mild_;
Which very Clubâ€”(it makes one Laugh)
_Omphale_ turn'd into a Distaff.

Nay, the _Hesperian_ Tree was this,
As shew the _Poma Veneris_;
These Apples doubtless were the Fruit
That 'twixt the Queens rais'd such Dispute,

To make 'em all _stark-naked_</pre></div> </div>
