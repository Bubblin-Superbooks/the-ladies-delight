And Pyramids and Trees together meet;

Statues amidst the thickest Grove arise,

And lofty Columns tow'ring to the Skies;

Then next an Obelisk its Shade displays,

And rustic Rockwork fills each empty Space;

Each joins to make it noble, and excells

Beaufets for Food, Grotto's for something else.

But hark! the Doors on jarring Hinges</pre></div> </div>
