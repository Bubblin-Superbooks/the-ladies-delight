<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent stretch-last-line ">Storm,
Where Water salt runs trickling down,

And _Tendrils_ lie o'er all the Ground,
Such as the Tree itself shoots forth,
And better if't be tow'rds the _North_;
When such a Piece of Ground you see,

If in the midst a Pit there be,
There plant it deep unto the _Root_,
And never fear——you'll soon have _Fruit_.
Tho' let young _Botanists_ beware

Of Insects that oft' harbour there,
Which 'mongst the tender _Fibres_ breed,
And if not kill'd, eat up the _Seed_:
Good _Humphrey Bowen_ gives</pre></div> </div>
