<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent stretch-last-line ">_Garden_.

That it's a _Tree_ right _sensitive_,

Denies no honest Man alive:

Tho' as one _shrinks_ and will not stand,

This _rises_ at a _Lady's_ Hand,

And grows more strong the more 'tis strok'd,

As others _fall_ when they are _pok'd_.

When nipping Cold bites off our Nose,

And hoary Frosts the Morn</pre></div> </div>
