Do what they will, she cannot be a Whore.

For _Mahomet_ may dream of heavenly Stews,

Where Virgin Rose, soon as it's lost, renews,

And shake with every Breath of Air serene,

As trembling for the Rapes they've daily seen;

When if those past can shake their Height profound,

_Ridotto_ sure will fell them to the Ground;

Here Art to Nature join'd makes it</pre></div> </div>
