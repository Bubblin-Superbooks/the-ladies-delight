Which 'cause it wears a colour'd Robe,
Is justly call'd the _flow'ring Shrub_.
In every Nation springs this Tree,

In some confin'd; in others more free;
In _England_, 'tis of mod'rate Size,
And oft' does _nine full inches_ rise:
But _Ireland_, tho' in Soil most poor,

Exceeds all Lands in this fame Store;
And sent o'er hither, it is such
As does exceed our own by much,
And gets the Owner many a _Farthing_,

For _Ladies_ love it in their _Garden_.
That it's a _Tree_ right _sensitive_,
Denies no honest Man</pre></div> </div>
