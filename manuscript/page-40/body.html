<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">good old Dame yeilds at the just Reproach, Cries—_Well my Dear, don't take too much!_ Thus various Joys soon waste the fleeting Night, And Sleep and Lust the Croud to Bed invite; Some in their Truckle-Beds to snore all Day, Others in Gambols with their Wh——es to play; The Dunghill Trapes, trickt up like virtuous Trull, If by good Chance, she gets a _Dupe_ or Cull; On Tallyman intrudes twelve Hours more, And for a clean Shift presumes to run a Score. Sages may say, that Arts and Science fail, And Ignorance and Folly have weigh'd down the Scale: In _England_ they have given new Arts a Rise, And what in Science wants, increase in Vice, And to be great as Angels when they fell, (If not exceed) at _least_ they equal _Hell_.</pre></div> </div>
