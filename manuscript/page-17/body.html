<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent stretch-last-line ">_Toasts_

And Bags by _Nature_ planted grow,

To keep 'em from all Winds that blow.

The Rise is slow, and by Degrees,

Both Fruits and Tree itself increase

So slow, that ten Years scarce produce

_Six Inches_ good and fit for Use;

But fifteen ripen well the Fruit,

And add a _viscous Balm_</pre></div> </div>
