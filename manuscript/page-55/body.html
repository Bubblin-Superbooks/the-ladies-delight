<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent stretch-last-line ">Tunes,

One _claps her Wings_ for Love, the other swoons;

Each _Vintner_ storms and swears he is undone,

Vollies of Oaths speak loud the Drawer's Moan;

_Porter_ who us'd to search for needful Girls,

Now sucks his Fingers, or his Apron twirls,

Bemoans his Loss of Business, and with Sighs,

In Box imprison'd lays the useless Dice.

_Spring-Garden_ now alone does all</pre></div> </div>
