To Back, Fore-part, or either Side——
Support a while, _and keep it up_,
Tho' soon again the Plant will droop.
_Motteux_ had one very untow'rd,

And thought to mend it with a Cord,
But _kill'd the Tree_, yet gain'd his _End_,
Which makes th' Experiment condemn'd.
Others have thought to mend the Root,

By taking from the Tree its Fruit;
But in the _Nutmegs_ lies the Breed,
And when they're gone we lose the _Seed_;
Tho' Virtuosi still have don't,

And always found it yield</pre></div> </div>
