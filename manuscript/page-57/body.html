And the spruce 'Prentice shines in Sword and Tye:

Bandy'd in Lace the City Dame appears,

Her Hair genteelly frizzled round her Ears;

Her Gown with _Tyrian_ Dyes most richly stain'd,

Glitt'ring with Orient Pearl from Orphans gain'd.

_My Lord_, to oblige his Spouse, takes Tickets three,

Crys, one's for you my Love, and one for me,

The third dispose as you shall best</pre></div> </div>
