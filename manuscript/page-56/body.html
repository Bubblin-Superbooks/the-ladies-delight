The Cit, the Wit, the Rake, the Fool, the Knight:

No Lady, that can pawn her Coat or Gown,

Will rest 'till she has laid the Money down:

Each Clerk will to the Joints his Fingers work,

And Counsellors find out some modern Querk,

To raise the Guinea, and to see the _Grot_,

And 'mongst the _Belles_ to slant it at _Ridolt_.

Here Seamstresses and Maids together</pre></div> </div>
