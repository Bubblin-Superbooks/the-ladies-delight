As other Trees bear Fruit at Top, And they who rob 'em must _climb up_; This still more rare doth upward shoot, But at the Bottom bears its Fruit, And they who'd reap its Virtues strong, Need but to lay 'em _all along_, _Ope' wide, their Mouths_, and they'll receive The _Fruit of Life_, and eat, and live: Not the fair Tree that _India_ bears, All over Spice both Head and Ears, Can boast more Gifts than the Great Pow'rs Have granted to this Tree of ours: That in good Ale its Power boasts, And ours has _Nutmeg's_ fit for _Toasts_ And Bags by _Nature_ planted grow, To keep 'em from all Winds that blow. The Rise is slow, and by Degrees, Both Fruits and Tree itself increase So slow, that ten Years scarce produce _Six Inches_ good and fit</pre></div> </div>
