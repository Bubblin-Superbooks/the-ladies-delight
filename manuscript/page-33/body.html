Soon stops each Grief, and every Qualm;

'Tis true, they sometimes Tumours cause,

And in the Belly make strange Flaws,

But a few Moons will make 'em sound,

And safely fetch the Swelling down.

Not Saffron chears the Heart like this,

Nor can Champaign give such a Bliss:

When Wife and Husband do fall</pre></div> </div>
