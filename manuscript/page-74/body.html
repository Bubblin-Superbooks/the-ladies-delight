For oh! sad Fate as they ascend the Stairs,

At the Room Door her good _Mamma_ appears,

Soon as she spies her Child with Looks demure,

She charges her to keep her _Vessel pure_:

Miss pertly answers to avoid her Doom,

_Mamma_, whose Hat and Wig is in the Room?

The good old Dame yeilds at the just Reproach,

Criesâ€”_Well my Dear, don't take too</pre></div> </div>
