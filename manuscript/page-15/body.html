<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent stretch-last-line ">Peel_

Or like a Cherry bright and gay,

Just red'ning in the Month of _May_.

As other Trees bear Fruit at Top,

And they who rob 'em must _climb up_;

This still more rare doth upward shoot,

But at the Bottom bears its Fruit,

And they who'd reap its Virtues strong,

Need but to lay 'em _all</pre></div> </div>
