this his Eunuchs in high Buskins tread—\nAnd chaunt harmonious Lays for this,—and _Bread_;\nFor this the _Assembly's_ fix'd; and the huge Dome\nSwells with the Lady's Vows, _when the Stake's gone_.—\n\nFor this he forms the vicious Masquerade,\nWhere Damsels may securely drive their Trade,\nFor which the Salesman, Chandler, Chairmen loudly pray,\nAnd Pickpockets too, _hail_ the joyful

eternal Columns raise,\nAnd every wanton Wife resound his Praise;\nLet Courtiers with implicit Faith obey,\nAnd to their grand Procurer Homage pay.\n\nNo more shall _Duchesses_ to _Bath_ repair,\nOr fly to _Tunbridge_ to procure an Heir;\n_Spring-Gardens_ can supply their every Want,\nFor here whate'er they ask the Swain wil grant,\n\nAnd future Lords (if they'll confess the right)\nShall owe their Being to this blessed Night;\nHence future Wickedness shall take its Rise,\n\n(For Masquerade to this is paultry Vice)\n\nAn Æra of new Crimes shall hence begin,\nAnd _H——gg——r_ chief Devil be

dine, that starv'd before,\nAnd Tallymen supply each needy Whore—\n\nFam'd _Covent-Garden_ droops with mournful Look,\nNor can St. _James's_ her great Rival brook:\nEach _Duck_ and D——ss, quacks to different Tunes,\nOne _claps her Wings_ for Love, the other swoons;\n\nEach _Vintner_ storms and swears he is undone,\nVollies of Oaths speak loud the Drawer's Moan;\n_Porter_ who us'd to search for needful Girls,\nNow sucks his Fingers, or his Apron twirls,\n\nBemoans his Loss of Business, and with Sighs,\nIn Box imprison'd lays the useless Dice.\n_Spring-Garden_ now alone does all invite\nThe Cit, the Wit, the Rake, the Fool, the Knight:\n\nNo Lady, that can pawn her Coat or Gown,\nWill rest 'till she has laid the Money down:\nEach Clerk will to the Joints his Fingers work,\nAnd Counsellors find out some modern Querk,\n\nTo raise the Guinea, and to see the _Grot_,\nAnd 'mongst the _Belles_ to slant it at _Ridolt_.\nHere Seamstresses and Maids together vie,\nAnd the spruce 'Prentice shines in Sword and Tye:\n\nBandy'd in Lace the City Dame appears,\nHer Hair genteelly frizzled round her Ears;\nHer Gown with _Tyrian_ Dyes most richly stain'd,\nGlitt'ring with Orient

every gentle Mistress in the Nation,\nFrom Suburb Whore, to ranting Dame of Fashion;\nFor none's so niece as to refuse the Suit,\n\nBut grasps the Tree tho' 'tis _forbidden Fruit_.\n_Near_ where _the Thames_ in pleasant Windings runs,\n_Near_ where the famous Glass-house fiercely burns,\n\n\n(Which to the Love of poor desponding Swains,\n\nAn Emblem terrible, but just retains.)\n_Near_ where fam'd _Vaux_ was to have fled,\n_With_ lighted Match, soon as he'd done the Deed;\nWhence some pretend to say by second Sight,\n\nThat it foreshew'd the Fate attends this Night,\n'Cause here the Fair will many _Matches light_.\n_Spring-Gardens_ lie shaded with verdant Trees,\nThat nod their reverend Heads at every Breeze;\n\nEmbassadors like _Turks_ hence send Express,\nAnd _Ministers of State_ like Devils dress—\nShould some wild _Indian_ see the various Scene,\nHe'd swear all Nations of the Earth do here convene,\n\nAnd take for quite reverse this medley Farce,\nThink Strumpers Saints, or catstick'd Beau a _Mars_.\nBut now the Dancers nimble Feet go round,\nAnd with just Measures beat the passive Ground,\nEach one inclines to different Delights—\n\nMusick the Fair, Sweetmeats the Beau invite;\nThe _Templar_ wisely does his Care enroll,\nPockets the Pheasant, and eats up the Fowls\nNor will return to join the giddy Rout,\n\n'Till he has eat and drank his _Guinea_ out.\nNow Dancing fires the Nymph to softer Joys;\nThe Musick's dull, the Wine and Sweetmeat cloys;\n_Strephon_ streight takes the Hint, withdraws a-while,\n\nBy soft Endearments does her Grief beguile;\nSoon they return more vig'rous than before,\nDo what they will, she cannot be a Whore.\nFor _Mahomet_ may dream of heavenly Stews,\n\nWhere Virgin Rose, soon as it's lost, renews,\nAnd shake with every Breath of Air serene,\nAs trembling for the Rapes they've daily seen;\nWhen if those past can shake their Height profound,\n\n_Ridotto_ sure will fell them to the Ground;\nHere Art to Nature join'd makes it compleat,\nAnd Pyramids and Trees together meet;\nStatues amidst the thickest Grove arise,\n\nAnd lofty Columns tow'ring to the Skies;\nThen next an Obelisk its Shade displays,\nAnd rustic Rockwork fills each empty Space;\nEach joins to make it noble, and excells\n\nBeaufets for Food, Grotto's for something else.\nBut hark! the Doors on jarring Hinges turn,\nAll enter in, and the blest Scene's begun;\nA thousand Lights their livid Flames display,\n\nPour forth their Blaze, and form a mimick Day:\nSudden a motley Mixture fills the Place,\nAnd Footmen shine as lordly as his Grace;\nTo see the sad Effect and Power of Change,\n\nLadies turn'd Men, in Breeches freely range:\nYoung smooth-chin'd Beaux turn Priests and Fryars,\nAnd Nun's chaste Habits hide our Country 'Squires.\n_Belles, Beaux_, and Sharpers here together play,\n\nAnd Wives throw their good Spouses Wealth away;\nAnd when their Cash runs low, and Fate runs cross,\nThey then _Cornute_ 'em to retrieve their Loss.\n_Dice_ and Intrigue so mutually are blended,\n\nThat one begins as soon as t'other's ended:\nA City Heiress blooming, rich, and fair,\nPicks up the Cards and Counters with great Care;\nAgainst her fate a smooth young Baron,\n\nWit he had none, Beauty he had his share on,\nA soft clear Skin, a dapper Neck and Waist,\nIn all Things suited to the modern Taste;\nAnd most polite, like all our modish Brood,\n\nThat is, a very Fool, who's very leud:\nHe ogles Miss, she squints, and turns aside,\nNor can her Mask her rising Blushes hide;\nAt last (as Bargains here are quickly made)\n\nShe yeilds to be Caress'd, tho' still afraid;\nShe cries, a private Room's for them most fit,\nFor Reputation is the Glory of a Cit;\nThis only is the Place, where in a Trice,\n\nSome Angel steals the Wounds of friendly Vice;\nThe Nymph finds a Relief for all her Pains,\nAnd the lost Maidenhead's restor'd again.\nBut who is he in Bower close confin'd,\n\nWith a kind Fair t' unbend his troubled Mind,\nSure by his Air, his Beauty, and his Grace,\nIt _Phoebus_ is, or some of heavenly Race.\nA petty Courtier, of small Estate and Sense,\n\nStood hearkning by, and cry'd it was the P——ce.\nYour Pardon, Sir, I knew it not before,\nFor my Mistake depended on his Whore,\nOne had _Latona_ to'ther has _L——r_.\n\nNext to the _Grotto_ let us bend our Eye,\nThe _Grotto_, Patron of Iniquity,\nSpeak O ye Trees with kind refreshing Shade,\nHow many Whores have at your Roots been made;\n\nAlas; how small the Number to what now,\nThis one, this happy Night, alone will shew\nSo many, that each conscious _Dryad_ flees,\nLest she too should be ravish'd thro' the Trees.\n\nNext rattling Dice invite th' attentive Ear,\nLords loudly laugh, as loud the Bullies swear:\nThe Country Knight o'th' Shire sells his Estate,\nAnd here with Heart intrepid meets his Fate;\n\nSo they withdrew to quench their glowing Flame,\nAnd to preserve the Honour of her Name;\nFor oh! sad Fate as they ascend the Stairs,\nAt the Room Door her good _Mamma_ appears,\n\nSoon as she spies her Child with Looks demure,\nShe charges her to keep her _Vessel pure_:\nMiss pertly answers to avoid her Doom,\n_Mamma_, whose Hat and Wig is in the Room?\n\nThe good old Dame yeilds at the just Reproach,\nCries—_Well my Dear, don't take too much!_\nThus various Joys soon waste the fleeting Night,\nAnd Sleep and Lust the Croud to Bed invite;\n\nSome in their Truckle-Beds to snore all Day,\nOthers in Gambols with their Wh——es to play;\nThe Dunghill Trapes, trickt up like virtuous Trull,\nIf by good Chance, she gets a _Dupe_ or Cull;\n\nOn Tallyman intrudes twelve Hours more,\nAnd for a clean Shift presumes to run a Score.\nSages may say, that Arts and Science fail,\nAnd Ignorance and Folly have weigh'd down the Scale:\n\nIn _England_ they have given new Arts a Rise,\nAnd what in Science wants, increase in Vice,\nAnd to be great as Angels when they fell,\n(If not exceed) at _least_ they equal _Hell_.</code>"
